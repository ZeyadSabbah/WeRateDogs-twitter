    "A script is created to contain the API keys and is added to the .gitignore file. Tweepy library is used to have an authorization for collecting the required data.  \n",
    "A for loop is iterated in the tweets ids provided in the tweets data provided previously where in the body of it get_status function is used to extract the retweet_count and favorite_count along with the tweet_id.  \n",
    "A new dataframe is created called ret_fav_count, the data is then stored to the repo, so these steps would not be repeated in the future and instead the read_csv function would be used to import the data. \n",
